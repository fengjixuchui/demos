# chimera_pe
ChimeraPE demo: maps another executable into the target process and runs both.<br/>
This is an alternative method to the classic RunPE (process hollowing) - can be used in case if we want to run the original exe also.<br/>
See also a template for a payload, that can be injected using this techique:
